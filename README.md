# 🔍 Featured Projects
### [Classification of Electrocardiogram Beats using Convolutional Neural Network](https://github.com/rongxian14/1D_CNN_ECG_Beat_Classification) 
*Individual Research | Python*
- Implemented SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) and Random Undersampling algorithms in Python to address class imbalance in the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Dataset.
- Developed an ECG beats classification model based on CNN, improving the annotation of both ECG beats and segments and outperforming the existing algorithm.
- Evaluated the performance of the ECG beats classification model using the accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score.
- Published a short paper based on the research work.
