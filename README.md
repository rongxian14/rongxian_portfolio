# 🔍 Featured Projects
### 🏥 [Classification of Electrocardiogram Beats using Convolutional Neural Network](https://github.com/rongxian14/1D_CNN_ECG_Beat_Classification) 
*Individual Research | Python (Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Keras, Sklearn, Tensorflow)*
- Implemented SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) and Random Undersampling algorithms in Python to address class imbalance in the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Dataset.
- Developed an ECG beats classification model based on CNN, improving the annotation of both ECG beats and segments and outperforming the existing algorithm.
- Evaluated the performance of the ECG beats classification model using the accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score.
- Published a short paper based on the research work.

### 🏥 [Prediction of Lung Cancer using Recursive Feature Elimination](https://github.com/NiesHW/SECB3203_P4B/tree/main/Group_Project/Group_4) 
*Group Research| Python (Numpy, Pandas, Keras, Sklearn, Tensorflow)*
- Predicted lung cancer based on the symptoms of the patients
- Developed and applied the RFE technique to systematically eliminate irrelevant features to enhance the accuracy of lung cancer prediction models.
- Developed the effectiveness of RFE in selecting the most relevant features for lung cancer prediction.

### 📊 [Factors Determining Loan Eligibility](https://github.com/rongxian14/Loan-Risk-Capstone-Project) 
*Data Storyteller | Excel Analytics, Power BI*
- Analysed factors affecting loan eligibility using Excel Analytics and Power BI.
- Created two interactive dashboards highlighting key insights such as the impact of credit history, self-employment, and property area on loan approval and default risks across different household groups.
- Applied design thinking principles (empathise, define, ideate) to develop actionable recommendations for enhancing applicant creditworthiness and improving loan approval
strategies.

### 📊 [BikeStore Sales Data Analysis](https://github.com/rongxian14/BikeStore-Sales-DA)
- Executed a full-scale business intelligence project using SQL Server, Excel, and Tableau — from database setup and SQL querying to data visualization — demonstrating strong analytical and technical integration across tools.
- Developed advanced interactive dashboards with Excel (PivotTables, slicers) and Tableau (bar charts, maps, treemaps, KPIs) to present dynamic sales insights, improving decision-making on customer and product performance.
- Generated actionable business recommendations by analyzing trends in revenue, store performance, and customer segmentation — guiding strategic focus on top-performing regions, sales reps, and product categories.

### 📱 [KinderJoy Mobile Application](https://github.com/DUOKinderJoy/mobile_app)
- Developed an application to facilitate parents to make online payments for study fees and the parents can also select whether their children will need meals for certain months.
- Involved in Use case diagram, Architecture Pattern, Package Diagram, Data Design, Requirements Traceability Matrix and Test Cases in System Documentation.

### 💻 [Web-Based News Aggregator](https://github.com/rongxian14/Web-based-News-Aggregator)
*Moderator & Reporter | HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL*
- Designed and developed a news aggregator website from scratch using HTML, CSS, PHP, and MySQL, following the Agile methodology with iterative sprints and stakeholder feedback to ensure continuous improvement and functional delivery.
- Implemented a user-centered design process including requirements gathering, wireframing, front-end development with responsive styling, and back-end data handling for user login and content storage using MySQL.
- Conducted usability testing and evaluation with real users using the WAMMI framework; collected and analyzed user feedback via questionnaires to refine usability, enhance user satisfaction, and drive iterative improvements.
